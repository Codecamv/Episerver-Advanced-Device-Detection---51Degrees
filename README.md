...and extend them with physical screen size information.

Combine with other criteria to create groups that become enabled when your call center is open, telephone calls are supported and the user is in the same time zone.

The simplest method of deploying to EPi is with NuGet. Just search for [51Degrees on nuget.episerver.com](http://nuget.episerver.com/en/?search=51degrees&sort=MostDownloads&page=1&pageSize=10 "51Degrees Packages on nuget.episerver.com").

This NuGet package includes 51Degrees free Lite device database. The Lite data is updated monthly by 51Degrees' professional team of analysts. An upgrade to 51Degrees enhanced device data is required to enable all features.

Upgrades include weekly and daily automatic data file updates and more accurate device detection.

Once you've obtained an enhanced data file more Visitor Group criterion will be available. Place the enhanced data file in the App_Data folder replacing 51Degrees.dat.

If you have a license key for 51Degrees place the key in a file named "51Degrees.lic" in the bin folder. New data files will automatically be downloaded updating App_Data/51Degrees.dat.
